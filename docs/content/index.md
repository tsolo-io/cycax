# CyCAx Documentation

Welcome to CyCAx - Code Your CAD/CAM/CAE - a Python package that provides tools for working with CAD models by integrating with existing open-source CAD tools.

## What is CyCAx?

CyCAx is **not** a CAD kernel. Instead, it's a powerful integration layer that allows you to:

- **Combine Multiple CAD Tools**: Work with OpenSCAD, FreeCAD, Blender, and build123d in a unified way
- **Create Complex Assemblies**: Build sophisticated assemblies from individual parts
- **Parametric Design**: Create reusable, parametric designs with Python code
- **Multiple Output Formats**: Generate STL, STEP, and other formats for 3D printing and manufacturing

## Quick Start

```python
from cycax.cycad import Assembly, Print3D

class MyPart(Print3D):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(part_no="my_part", x_size=50, y_size=30, z_size=10)

# Create an assembly
assembly = Assembly("my_assembly")
part = MyPart()
assembly.add(part, "main_part")

# Save and render
assembly.save()
assembly.render()
```

## Key Features

### ðŸ”§ **Multi-Engine Support**
Choose from different CAD engines based on your needs:
- **OpenSCAD**: Great for parametric modeling
- **FreeCAD**: Professional CAD features
- **build123d**: Modern Python-native CAD
- **Blender**: Advanced visualization and assemblies

### ðŸ“¦ **Assembly-First Design**
Build complex products by combining parts into assemblies with automatic positioning and constraint systems.

### ðŸŽ¯ **Part Types**
- **Print3D**: Parts designed for 3D printing
- **SheetMetal**: Flat parts for laser cutting or machining
- **Cuboid/Cylinder**: Basic geometric shapes
- **Custom Parts**: Define your own part types (future feature)

### ðŸ”— **Integration Options**
- **Direct Integration**: Use tools installed on your system
- **Server Integration**: Use CyCAx Server for remote processing
